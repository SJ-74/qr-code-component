### What I learned

Firstly I'll say this challenge is a very beginner friendly challenge for getting started. No media-queries, no grid, hover effects etc. Just the basic concepts that's it. I liked this challenge for being this much user-friendly. Oerall had a nice experience. Also, this is the first FEM challenge in which I used SCSS.

### Continued development

Animation, pseudo-elements, better css, and mostly css grid.
